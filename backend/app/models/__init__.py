"""SQLAlchemy ORM models â€“ placeholder stage.

In later phases we will implement actual tables and relationships. For now we
only declare a `Base` instance so alembic can establish a migration baseline.

# Import model classes so that they are registered on *Base.metadata*.
# This is required for `create_all()` and alembic autogeneration to discover
# tables. Keep these imports at the bottom to avoid circular dependencies.
